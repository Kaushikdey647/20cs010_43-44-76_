# Lamport's Clock and Data Synchronization Algorithm Project

This project is an implementation of Lamport's Clock and Data Synchronization Algorithm. The goal of this project is to design a system that can synchronize data across multiple processes using Lamport's Clock Algorithm.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and run the Makefile. The Makefile will compile and link the necessary files.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
make
```

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- Source files are located in the `src` directory.
- Object files are generated in the `obj` directory.
- The final executable is located in the `bin` directory.

## Running the Project

After building the project using the Makefile, you can run the executable from the `bin` directory.

```bash
./bin/<executable-name>
```

## Cleaning Up

To clean up the project (remove the `obj` and `bin` directories), run the following command:

```bash
make clean
```
